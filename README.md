Start implementing and testing various interesting algorithms. For each algorithm, provide complete working python code including pytest tests. Don't ask if I want to create another one, just keep creating them, one after the other. Put any explanation of what you are doing as comments in the code. You can't just write the code with the test: the test has to pass, and you have to print the output of the passing test, before you move on to the next algorithm. Focus on algorithms that you have high confidence in implementing correctly and passing tests on the very first attempt.
